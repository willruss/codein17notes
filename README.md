 # Task: movingblock-Develop a simple interface screen
  * First I cloned the Terasology repo
  
  * I used the command ./gradlew idea
  
  * I decided to use the sample module as a template rather than creating a module from scratch
  
  * I created a JSON called "environmentInfoScreen.ui" with the code:
  ```   "type": "EnvironmentInfoScreen",
    "contents": {
        "type": "UILabel",
        "text": "Environment Info"
